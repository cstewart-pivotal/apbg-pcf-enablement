# APBG Self-Paced Enablement
## Description
This repository is intended to serve as self-guided enablement on APBG, Pivotal and Pivotal products and technologies including PCF and Spring.

## APBG what?
The Accenture Pivotal Business Group (APBG) is a global strategic partnership between Accenture and Pivotal, combining resources, practices and scale.

Our vision is to accelerate our clientsâ€™ enablement and app transformation journeys.

This is a collaboration between our two companies focusing on enabling Accenture to enable our joint customers, via Pivotal-like services, at scale, and driving consumption of Pivotal Cloud Foundry across legacy app estates.

The services we are bringing to market can be broken out into two large categories:
- Customer-centric greenfield Application Development
- Application Transformation of legacy workloads

Both of these services utilize agile methodologies to continuously deliver results to customers fast, and take advantage of the numerous benefits of running on PCF. Learn more about both of these offerings.

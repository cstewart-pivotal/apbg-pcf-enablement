### Platform Acceleration Lab (PAL)
The Platform Acceleration Lab (PAL) is an immersive, best practices set of courses that enables developers and architects to develop new applications, move applications (replatforming), and modernize existing applications on Pivotal Cloud Foundry. The PAL is designed to enable through "doing it" rather than "talking about it."

There are two courses provided by the PAL:
- Cloud-Native Developer (CND)
- Cloud-Native Architect (CNA)

#### PAL CND Course
The PAL CND class focuses on **new application development**.

_Build cloud-native applications during these one-week Cloud-Native Developer (CND) courses. Pivotal experts will teach you how to build a single application, then evolve the application to cloud-native running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry._

_You will also learn the fundamentals of Pivotal Cloud Foundry, CI/CD, Application Architecture, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud Services—as well as be exposed to many of Pivotal’s core practices._

This course is offered for both Java and .NET Developers.

The Java CND course  has a corresponding certification associated with it, *Pivotal Certified Developer*.

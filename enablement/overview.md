### APBG Webinar Series
A good place to start is to watch the APBG Webinar Series which ran in ACN FY18 Q4 as a 6-part webinar series focusing on topics to bring greater awareness and familiarity to the Cloud-Native Platform (PCF 2.0) and Cloud-Native Application Development technologies and solutions.

The topics covered:
- Cloud-Native Platform: Pivotal Cloud Foundry Platform
    - PCF 2.0 Overview
    - PKS Overview and PFS Preview

- Cloud-Native Application Development: PCF and Spring Frameworks
    - Cloud Native Java
    - Cloud Native .NET

- Cloud-Native Operations: PCF Operations and Enabling DevOps
    - BOSH Overview
    - Platform and Application DevOps & CI/CD

The recordings of these sessions are available in [myLearning](https://mylearning.accenture.com/myl-ui/learner/activityDetails?referrer=activitySupDetails.sessionDetails&activityID=1521458&source=LMS&refresh=349) where the repository for all of the recorded sessions exist.

### Workshops
These light-weight workshops are half to full day workshops that are ideally delivered in-person but could be delivered remotely if need be.

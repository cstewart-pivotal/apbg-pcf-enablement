### BOSH Workshop
BOSH is the toolchain at the heart of Cloud Foundry that is largely responsible for giving  operational excellence to Cloud Foundry users. BOSH is the automation that allows Cloud Foundry to be multi-cloud, to do zero-downtime deployments and allows workloads to benefit from 4 levels of High Availability.

This workshop will include presentations reviewing BOSH concepts as well as hands-on labs. This workshop is ideally geared towards PCF operators or advanced PCF users wanting to learn more about what's happening under the hood.

### PCF Developer Workshop

### Cloud-Native Java Workshop
This workshop is designed for Java developers to get hands-on experience working with the [Spring](spring.io) framework and its various projects including Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

This workshop has minimal presentations and is focused around hands-on labs to give developers a deep dive into building modern Java applications that are built to run in the cloud.

### PKS Workshop
This workshop is intended to give developers a hands-on experience working with PKS. We'll cover an overview of Docker and Kubernetes, the popularity of containers as a way of packaging up applications and the rise of container platforms like Kubernetes. We'll understand the value added to PKS vs open-source Kubernetes and we'll discuss the differences between PAS and PKS, and how to correctly identify which workloads should run on which abstraction layer.

Concepts will be presented and hands-on labs will give participants a hands on experience with using Docker, PKS and deploying apps to both runtimes.

### Concourse Workshop
Concourse is an automation powerhouse that can be leveraged to continuously deliver applications to PCF or PCF itself. This workshop will give developers hands-on experience creating automation pipelines for both applications and platform.

## [PKS Workshop](https://github.com/cstewart-pivotal/apbg-pks-workshop)

### Overview
This workshop is intended to give developers a hands-on experience working with PKS. We'll cover an overview of Docker and Kubernetes, the popularity of containers as a way of packaging up applications and the rise of container platforms like Kubernetes. We'll understand the value added to PKS vs open-source Kubernetes and we'll discuss the differences between PAS and PKS, and how to correctly identify which workloads should run on which abstraction layer.
Concepts will be presented and hands-on labs will give participants a hands on experience with using Docker, PKS and deploying apps to both runtimes.
